## Finding the boss of zone

Instead of fighting the boss of a zone after a pre-determined number of encounters, each encounter may reward you with a "clue" to help find the boss.

Reason to collect clues as fast as possible and fight early: conserve food (food is consumed per party member each day) and the next zone will have more powerful rewards.

Reason to stay and not fight boss right away: if you fear you can't beat boss or it will be too costly. Also bosses have weaknesses and you may want to wait to add something to your party that will counter boss. Also there may be a complete set of gear or rewards tied to the zome which you are close to completing.

## Food system

Start each zone with some food, find more randomly. It could be an option for room rewards, an alternative to money or upgrades. Ability to generate more food is a innate bonus of some party members.

Default to feeding all party members. When food starts to run out, can strategically starve some units who will gain Hunger I, Hunger II etc. debuffs on their abilities/health.

Get food from bosses so never enter the next zone hungry.

Food is your timer for how long you can stay in a zone. But moving to the next zone with a greater food supply will mean you can stay in that higher reward zone for yet longer.

## Perishable and non-perishable food

This system may well not add much to the game and not be something to implement.

Perishable food rots after a set amount of time, so can only be usefully stockpiled up to a certain point. Non-perishable food is much more valuable, but more expensive.

Dipping into your non-perishable food should be the consequence for bad luck or poor planning, as a buffer against starvation. Actual starvation is the consequence of those things happening too many times and you run out of non-perishable food.

## Unit diversity

Take inspiration from TFT. In TFT you can build "wide", having your team strength come from a lot of traits. Or it can come from "tall", a three-star carry who does all the heavy lifting.

Low rarity units are powerful because you can easily make a three star unit of them. Rare units are inherently more powerful in their abilities and stats, level for level.

We might want to whole sale steal the traits system.
