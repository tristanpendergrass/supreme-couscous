# Ideas

## Finding the boss of zone

Instead of fighting the boss of a zone after a pre-determined number of encounters, each encounter may reward you with a "clue" to help find the boss.

Reason to collect clues as fast as possible and fight early: conserve food (food is consumed per party member each day) and the next zone will have more powerful rewards.

Reason to stay and not fight boss right away: if you fear you can't beat boss or it will be too costly. Also bosses have weaknesses and you may want to wait to add something to your party that will counter boss. Also there may be a complete set of gear or rewards tied to the zome which you are close to completing.

## Food system

Start each zone with some food, find more randomly. It could be an option for room rewards, an alternative to money or upgrades. Ability to generate more food is a innate bonus of some party members.

Default to feeding all party members. When food starts to run out, can strategically starve some units who will gain Hunger I, Hunger II etc. debuffs on their abilities/health.

Get food from bosses so never enter the next zone hungry.

Food is your timer for how long you can stay in a zone. But moving to the next zone with a greater food supply will mean you can stay in that higher reward zone for yet longer.

## Perishable and non-perishable food

This system may well not add much to the game and not be something to implement.

Perishable food rots after a set amount of time, so can only be usefully stockpiled up to a certain point. Non-perishable food is much more valuable, but more expensive.

Dipping into your non-perishable food should be the consequence for bad luck or poor planning, as a buffer against starvation. Actual starvation is the consequence of those things happening too many times and you run out of non-perishable food.

## Unit diversity

Take inspiration from TFT. In TFT you can build "wide", having your team strength come from a lot of traits. Or it can come from "tall", a three-star carry who does all the heavy lifting.

Low rarity units are powerful because you can easily make a three star unit of them. Rare units are inherently more powerful in their abilities and stats, level for level.

We might want to whole sale steal the traits system.

## Move Accuracy

There should be a grade or percent correct score for the move. When complete it will have a fraction of its affect accordingly, whether damage or utility.

Hitting the parts of the move in the wrong order will lower the accuracy, naturally, so more complicated moves run the risk of not working as well as the simpler ones.

Some enemies will have an attack that adds an errant "mistake" into the move set if they go off while the move is being executed. The strategy thus becomes to avoid doing your
high impact moves when the enemy is about to interfere.

Some ally buffs could protect against this, or improve the accuracy above 100% for extra effect.

## How players express mastery

There are two primary axis along which the player can perform better or worse:

1. How quickly and reliably the player dispatches commands to their team. This is largely a matter of muscle memory, although there will be large gulfs in player aptitude, even after playing for a long time. Players that have low skill in this dimension should generally be facing a fun but manageable challenge with a team of all simple characters plus one complex one. Players of intermediate skill should well handle teams with more complex characters, and masters of this axis should almost but not quite be able to get the full potential from a team of complex characters.

2. Metagame strategy. Choosing the right upgrades and team composition. Decisions about team comp look a lot like they do in TFT.

## Dodging

When a dodge is maximally successful it should result in 50% damage mitigation. We want this to feel like a full success-- use whatever visual clues are necessary to drive that home. There are a few reasons for this:

- Even when effectively blocking, healing should still feel relevant
- More knobs to turn on balance-- you can make the dodge harder or increase the damage.
- The ability to completely block damage can be reserved as a cool reward or rarer upgrade that will feel very impactful. There's going to be a significant psychological impact to "zero" as in complete damage mitigation and it would be nice if that weren't the everyday scenario when you blocked.

Dodging patterns should derive from the monster you're fighting, not from the ally doing the blocking. Allies already feel very different from each other because they have their own moves with different patterns. The enemies also need to feel different from each other, and not just interchangeable punching bags of varying health pools.

## Enemy ideas

- An aggressive but squishy enemy that makes lots of smaller attacks.
- A tanky enemy. It would have a vast health pool, non-threatening attacks, and charge a large unblockable hit. This will feel like a damage check and rewards high damage comps.
- An enemy that rewards timing your attacks correctly. They deploy a shield blocking percent of damage periodically.
