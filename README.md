# Roadmap

## Refactor action system

[ ]

## Improve look and feel of simple moves

[x] Support multiple moves per ally
[x] Randomly choose between moves
[x] Allow inputs to be shown that aren't part of recipe
[ ] Inputs should be disabled after being selected once
[ ] Inputs should "flash" before being disabled when selected to give tactile feedback to player
[ ] Change recipes to approximately match simple CSD foods

## Add dodging or some sort of enemy interaction
